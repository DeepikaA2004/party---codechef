Then put your hands up
Chef wants to host a party with a total of 
N people.
However, the party hall has a capacity of 
X people. Find whether Chef can host the party.

## Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers

Each character of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase. That is, the strings NO, no, nO, and No will be treated as equivalent.

## Constraints
1<=T<=100  <br>
1<=N,X<=10
